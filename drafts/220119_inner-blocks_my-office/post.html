<h2>On disability.</h2>
  <p>This is just a quick post to show everyone here around my office. Nice place, huh? Great views! üòÅ I'm @frittro, the bloke on the ground, in the blue t-shirt and fluro-topped work socks. My wife @frittni is sitting on her walker beside me. In this photo, we are at Henderson Park, in West Auckland, New Zealand (see <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/44773284" target="_blank">map</a>). The carpark behind us is the main carpark just off Wilsher Crescent, and there are two ‚ôø disability parking spaces available there. The park itself is all flat, and has well maintained, smooth walkways throughout. It is actually part of the W1 West Auckland Cycleway route, so there are often cyclists riding through the park.
</p>
  <p>As you can probably tell from the photo, both my wife and I have physical disabilities. My wife was born with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_bifida" target="_blank">Spina Bifida</a>, and I have various ailments which I've mentioned in <a href="https://ecency.com/hive-106316/@frittro/introducing-my-selfhosting-project-for" target="_blank">another post</a> recently. My heart issues are why I, too, have my own mobility aide. I can't walk far without getting tired and needing to sit down. Between the two of us, we have quite the collection of mobility aides, including the walkers, crutches, and a wheelchair.</p>

  <h2>On mental health.</h2>
  <p>Today we came down to the park here to meet up with a few friends from <a href="https://www.teata.org.nz/" target="_blank">Te Ata</a>, which is a mental health peer-support group that I belong to. This is the first time that we had met together in-person this year, and for quite some time before that, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. It was good to catch up with them again, but sad to hear that one of the staff is planning to leave, this year.</p>
  <p>In 2010, I was diagnosed with a <a href="https://ecency.com/created/depression" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmeuL4hHvevHt7YnmwR1hE6hmd1q7Zkrqk8SKfU2rFBnnH/mhnz.png"/> major depressive disorder</a>, and it was during this period that I came to be diagnosed also as being on the <a href="https://ecency.com/created/actuallyautistic" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZCG6iPzkfHputwavX2hX5bGgpEQWcTSuSoGzL7f6RAfu/actually_autistic_18px.png"/> Autism Spectrum</a>. In fact, that was also the same year that I was diagnosed with type 2 <a href="https://ecency.com/created/diabetes" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmX8nx8LoK2S67ipYdPekSvTSW5XRTYPdyng53DJdKSeUc/diabetes_18px.png"/> diabetes</a>! It all hit me at once. No wonder I'm so screwed up, haha!</p>
  <p>Te Ata has been really helpful to me though, giving me something that I can look forward to during the week. It is a pity that the pandemic has spoiled that a bit, recently. Hopefully we can keep this new Omicron strain out of New Zealand, so that activities like Te Ata can resume again.</p>
  <p>Anyway, this was just a brief update. I'm still working on my homelab project, and I will be blogging again about that soon.</p>
