# Introducing my selfhosting project for 2022

Body text summary goes here. Write it last!

## Who I am

<span style="float:right;padding-left:10px;">![](frittro-and-kitten.png)</span>Greetings,
I am [@frittro](https://ecency.com/@frittro), a newcomer to the
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">![hive_18px.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png)
HIVE</span> blockchain. I live in Auckland, New Zealand. I am an _"older adult"_
(or an _"elder geek"_, or _"silver surfer"_, but never _"ok boomer"_, please). I
am married for 21 years to `@frittni`, with no children (unfortunately), and
currently no pets of our own either. We have close friends who run a cattery
though, so we enjoy their company, at least. I am

and a

condition, with stents in my heart. I also have a

What this all means, and how it all works together, is something like this...

My wife `@frittni` was born with

Spina Bifida</span>, and she manages pretty well on crutches, or a walker, or
sometimes in a wheelchair. We are both in the 50+ age bracket, and both are
welfare beneficiaries at present. `@frittni` has a teriary degree, and has
experience in radio broadcasting. I never completed my tertiary education, due
to (at the time) undiagnosed Autism-related issues, and depression. I have a
varied employment history, including deckhanding on a big game fishing vessel;
fisheries research; horticultural contracting; I was a business owner of a small
computer repair business; adult educator in a
<abbr title="Private Training Establishment">PTE</abbr> teaching computing
subjects; and corrections / offender monitoring for those people wearing
"traceable ankle jewellery" out in the community. I've done all sorts of things
over the years.

## Who I was

I was [@trisquelwhare](https://ecency.com/@trisquelwhare), an account migrated
to the
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">![hive_18px.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png)
HIVE</span> blockchain from the
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">![steem_18px.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQmdiTk78nWRoEwdcELgAWmzVpeyMBoQuLcfu3ku37n6S44/steem_18px.png)
Steem</span> blockchain. I was active on there from late 2017 through most of
2018, and got hooked on SteemMonsters (SM), which is now called Splinterlands. I
disappeared in late 2018 with health issues, and tried to make a comeback in
2019, but still wasn't really well enough. I'm still not 100% better, and my
cardiologist says that I probably never will be, but at least I'm starting to
get back into some of the things that I could do back then.

<span style="float:right;padding-left:10px;">![contest_kings_with_steemmonstershow_200px.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQmUsnNWpLDw2kSUJWVkaHYRii3sBzp9r19cDHNNUBDkDvv/contest_kings_with_steemmonstershow_200px.png)</span>I
used to be in a SM guild called
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">![ck_lion2_16px.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQmeqPKWWYLovjdQcE2hntvtUPRfTuMfsSMvUgDokRZc3BL/ck_lion2_16px.png)
ContestKings</span>, where I was the scribe, responsible for generating the
guild member rankings and statistics graphs, along with a curation trail of
SM-themed contest posts. I didn't run it, I was just the scribe, doing the
slog-work of generating the articles. I got "paid" in SM cards, and built up
quite [a nice collection](https://peakmonsters.com/@trisquelwhare/cards) of
Alpha and Beta edition SM cards! 😜 I was very active in the SM community back
then, and participated in several of the SteemMonster Show events which were run
by [@coruscate](https://ecency.com/@coruscate/) and
[@littlescribe](https://ecency.com/@littlescribe). I also did a bit of graphic
design stuff for the SteemMonster Show back in the day, too. Those were some fun
times. I fondly remember episodes of the "SteemMonster Tavern", which I even
participated in ocassionally. What a blast that was! Was that part of the
SteemMonster Show, or was it part of The Playhouse, with
[@carrieallen](https://ecency.com/@carrieallen) and
[@chrisroberts](https://ecency.com/@chrisroberts)? Gosh, I'm getting confused
now, hehe. But I certainly have some very fond memories of those days. A large
part of my SM card collection came from the generosity of
[@clove71](https://ecency.com/@clove71), who always was such a kind and helpful
person. I understand that she is still at it, and is arguably the biggest
account in Splinterlands. Nice!

in those days, I also used to play a lot of Steempunk.net,
