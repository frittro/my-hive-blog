<h2>Who I am</h2>
<p></p><div class="pull-right"> <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmb3BZXRDWsvhRiLgZaqbt4Dgjs4QrJqceLYvuQZFRW9aP/frittro_and_kitten.png"/></div>Greetings, I am @frittro, a newcomer to the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE blockchain. I live in Auckland, New Zealand. I am an <em>"older adult"</em> (or an <em>"elder geek"</em>, or <em>"silver surfer"</em>, but never <em>"ok boomer"</em>, please). I have been married for 21 years to @frittni, with no children (unfortunately), and currently no pets of our own either. We have close friends who run a cattery though, so we enjoy their company, at least. I am <a href="https://ecency.com/created/actuallyautistic"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZCG6iPzkfHputwavX2hX5bGgpEQWcTSuSoGzL7f6RAfu/actually_autistic_18px.png"/> actually autistic</a>, I have type 2 <a href="https://ecency.com/created/diabetes"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmX8nx8LoK2S67ipYdPekSvTSW5XRTYPdyng53DJdKSeUc/diabetes_18px.png"/> diabetes</a>, and a <a href="https://ecency.com/created/cardiac"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZHGLmBqj5zPLnRTNv8jvUx8hP3S9UvdiK3GoUiHGKHCk/heart_fdn_18px.png"/> cardiac</a> condition, with stents in my heart. I also have a <a href="https://ecency.com/created/depression"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmeuL4hHvevHt7YnmwR1hE6hmd1q7Zkrqk8SKfU2rFBnnH/mhnz.png"/> major depressive disorder</a>. What this all means, and how it all works together, is something like this...</p>
<p><div class="pull-left"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmWoFaEcQX8TRtzXtzM5Vi8CCkdh1KgzLJjGh9BxXacxb2/my_health.png"/></div>My wife @frittni was born with <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmQ8Z2DMYf7Sq4ssFra8AbSZvfA5Qir3uGfSGpkjTP6rTM/sb_ribbon_18px.png"/> Spina Bifida, and she manages pretty well on crutches, or a walker, or sometimes in a wheelchair. We are both in the 50+ age bracket, and both are welfare beneficiaries at present. @frittni has a tertiary degree, and has experience in radio broadcasting. I never completed my tertiary education, due to (at the time) undiagnosed Autism-related issues, and depression. I have a varied employment history, including deckhanding on a big game fishing vessel; fisheries research; horticultural contracting; I was a business owner of a small computer repair business; adult educator in a <abbr title="Private Training Establishment">PTE</abbr> teaching computing subjects; and corrections / offender monitoring for those people wearing "traceable ankle jewellery" out in the community. I've done all sorts of things over the years.</p>

<h2>Who I was</h2>
<p>I was @trisquelwhare, an account migrated to the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE blockchain from the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmdiTk78nWRoEwdcELgAWmzVpeyMBoQuLcfu3ku37n6S44/steem_18px.png"/> Steem blockchain. I was active on there from late 2017 through most of 2018, and got hooked on SteemMonsters (SM), which is now called Splinterlands. I disappeared in late 2018 with health issues, and tried to make a comeback in 2019, but still wasn't really well enough. I'm still not 100% better, and my cardiologist says that I probably never will be, but at least I'm starting to get back into some of the things that I could do back then.</p>
<p><div class="pull-right"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmUsnNWpLDw2kSUJWVkaHYRii3sBzp9r19cDHNNUBDkDvv/contest_kings_with_steemmonstershow_200px.png"/></div> I used to be in a SM guild called <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmeqPKWWYLovjdQcE2hntvtUPRfTuMfsSMvUgDokRZc3BL/ck_lion2_16px.png"/> ContestKings, where I was the scribe, responsible for generating the guild member rankings and statistics graphs, along with a curation trail of SM-themed contest posts. I didn't run it, I was just the scribe, doing the slog-work of generating the articles. I got "paid" in SM cards, and built up quite <a href="https://peakmonsters.com/@trisquelwhare/cards">a nice collection</a> of Alpha and Beta edition SM cards! 😜 I was very active in the SM community back then, and participated in several of the SteemMonster Show events which were run by @coruscate and @littlescribe. I also did a bit of graphic design stuff for the SteemMonster Show back in the day, too. Those were some fun times. I fondly remember episodes of the "SteemMonster Tavern", which I even participated in ocassionally. What a blast that was! Was that part of the SteemMonster Show, or was it part of The Playhouse, with @carrieallen and @chrisroberts? Gosh, I'm getting confused now, hehe. But I certainly have some very fond memories of those days. A large part of my SM card collection came from the generosity of @clove71, who always was such a kind and helpful person. I understand that she is still at it, and is arguably the biggest account in Splinterlands. Nice!</p>
