  <h1>HivePUD Feb-2022, plus monthly account stats</h1>
  <h2>Powering up at least $ʰⁱᵛᵉ10.00 as HP.</h2>
  <p>Today is the 1st February 2022, and this is my first ever <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE Power Up Day ( #HivePUD ) submission. The concept is simple. On the first day of every month, we power up at least $ʰⁱᵛᵉ10.00 liquid Hive into Hive Power (HP). This will increase our own voting power on the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE blockchain, meaning that our upvotes are worth more in the future. This is my first HivePUD submission, because I am only quite new to the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE social blockchain, having only been here for less than one month. However, I was on the legacy social blockchain some three years ago, so I totally get the concept of powering up my $ʰⁱᵛᵉ into HP to increase my stake, making my upvotes worth more.</p>
  <p><div class="pull-left"><img src="" alt="screenshot of staking my $ʰⁱᵛᵉ10.00"/></div>I have been able to stake $ʰⁱᵛᵉxx.xx of liquid Hive last month, as you can see from the screenshot here. I may not be able to achieve such a level in future months, as I am a sickness beneficiary, living on a fixed income with not a lot of room to spare for investing in crypto. Much of my liquid $ʰⁱᵛᵉ last month has come from transferring over my assets from the legacy social blockchain. I must thank @thekittygirl, @stayten, and @pravesh0 for their help in <a href="" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmWrFKs6ritavByiU3cdeCQg5AtaJgHoV2ZJrCnKK3Bhe4/theterminal_18px.png"/> <strong>The Terminal</strong></a> Discord server recently, guiding me on how to achieve my first real crypto trade, and converting some of my crypto from the legacy social blockchain over to the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE blockchain as liquid $ʰⁱᵛᵉ. Below you will find a list of other sources of my liquid $ʰⁱᵛᵉ from the preceeding month, which I have staked for #HivePUD today.</a></p>
  <h2>Acknowledging where this $ʰⁱᵛᵉ came from.</h2>
  <p><ol>
  <li><strong>@pravesh0</strong> – I received a very generous gift of $ʰⁱᵛᵉ2.00 from Pravesh last month, to get me over the $ʰⁱᵛᵉ10.00 liquid Hive limit, when it looked like I wouldn't be able to reach the #HivePUD goal today. Thanks so much for this, Pravesh, you're a champion!</li>
  <li><strong>Creation & Curation rewards</strong> – I have had some great responses to my blog posts and comments here on <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE last month. Particularly my #introduceyourself post, which gained a lot of very nice upvotes from people here. Thank you so much to everyone who upvoted my posts and comments last month, it has made a huge difference to my liquid $ʰⁱᵛᵉ wallet, which has now been powered up.</li>
  <li><strong>Reblogs</strong> – I would also like to acknowledge those who have reblogged my posts last month. This is very helpful, as it widens my audience to include theirs, which very often can subsequently contribute to my creation rewards. Last month my rebloggers were: @hernleon74, @cheelbire, @forykw, @repayme4568, @alvonzo, @wesphilbin, @maulidar, @cribbio, @marcocasario. Thank you to all of you! I hope to repay the favour in the future.</li>
  <li><strong>Delegations</strong> – All of that posting and commenting which I did last month would not have been possible so early in my existence here on the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE social blockchain, were it not for a couple of very generous delegations I received early on. I'd like to mention especially @thekittygirl and <a href="" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmWrFKs6ritavByiU3cdeCQg5AtaJgHoV2ZJrCnKK3Bhe4/theterminal_18px.png"/> <strong>The Terminal</strong></a>'s @rc-assist account. Without them, along with the initial delegation I received from @ecency when I created my account, I would not have been able to do much creation or curation at all here.</li>

  <p>As I have only just started here on the  <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE social blockchain this month, so I really don't have anything to compare my growth against from the previous month. Starting next month I will be giving a brief overview of where I was previously, as a quick reminder, before I post the account statistics which you will see below. This time, however, there is nothing really to compare against.</p>
  <p>However, I did post the image below in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/520706252557516802/521504707018227712/933220288894754816" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmWrFKs6ritavByiU3cdeCQg5AtaJgHoV2ZJrCnKK3Bhe4/theterminal_18px.png"/> <strong>The Terminal</strong></a> Discord server earlier in the month, and it gives an interesting comparison of my progress on the legacy social blockchain, compared to this time around.</p>
