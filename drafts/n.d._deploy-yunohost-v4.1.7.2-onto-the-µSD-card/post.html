I think this particular one used to be installed in a tablet PC at one stage. I tend to move stuff around and recycle it often. I know this isn't a good practice when setting up a server, but I have to live within tight budget constraints as well, being elderly and retired, and on a fixed weekly income now.</p>

  <h2>How it all begins.</h2>
  <p>I'm at my laptop, logged in to the operating system, which is currently still Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) for now. The first thing that I reach for is my µSD-card and the card reader. I know that there will be some crap on it from the last time I used it, but I am diligent with my backups, so I'm unafraid to blank the card and start again. The first command I issue from the command line terminal will do just that. First, I need to ensure that I'm working on the correct drive. I'd hate to wipe out my booting system!<br/>
<code><pre>user@laptop:~$ lsblk
  ( ... output trimmed ... )
  sdb      8:16   1  29.5G  0 disk
  ├─sdb1   8:17   1   256M  0 part /media/user/boot
  └─sdb2   8:18   1  29.3G  0 part /media/user/rootfs</pre></code></p>
  <p>Okay, so it looks like I am after the <code>sdb</code> drive, in my case. If you are following along, it is important that you get this right for your own environment!<br/>
<code><pre>user@laptop:~$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=<strong>/dev/sdb</strong> bs=4096 status=progress
  [sudo] password for user:
  31687921664 bytes (32 GB, 30 GiB) copied, 2272 s, 13.9 MB/s
  dd: error writing '/dev/sdb': No space left on device
  7737089+0 records in
  7737088+0 records out
  31691112448 bytes (32 GB, 30 GiB) copied, 2272.42 s, 13.9 MB/s</pre></code></p>
  <p>Can anyone spot the mistake that I have made already? In my case, it isn't a major issue, and I can carry on. But for you, this might be a disaster! Hint: <spoiler>compare the capacity of the µSD-card that I just blanked out.</spoiler></p>
