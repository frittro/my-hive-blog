  <h1>HivePUD Mar-2022, plus monthly account stats</h1>
  <h2>Powering up at least $ʰⁱᵛᵉ10.00 as HP.</h2>
  <p>Today is the 1st March 2022, and this is my second <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE Power Up Day ( #HivePUD ) submission. I wasn't able to participate fully in last month's #HivePUD event as, although I had powered up at least $ʰⁱᵛᵉ10.00 liquid Hive as required, I was still way short of the minimum 100ʜᴩ staked that is also required, to be eligible for most of the reward pools for the event. During February, I had a major push to reach that goal. As you will see in the infographic below, I was able to reach my goal with 5 days to spare!</p>

While the infographic above shows that I reached my first goal of 100ʜᴩ staked; getting a further $ʰⁱᵛᵉ10.00 to stake on the day was proving to be more difficult. With my ongoing power-downs of my legacy accounts, I was able to raise just over $ʰⁱᵛᵉ7.00 liquid to be staked. Not long before the end of the month, I received a very generous gift of another $ʰⁱᵛᵉ5.00 liquid towards my goal, from @wesphilbin. Because of this generosity, I was able to power up just over $ʰⁱᵛᵉ12.00 on #HivePUD today, 1-Mar-2022. Yay! Thanks so much Wes, for coming to my rescue. This will become my second HivePUD submission. Below you will find a list of other sources of my liquid $ʰⁱᵛᵉ from the preceeding month, which I have staked for #HivePUD today.</p>
  <h2>Acknowledging where this $ʰⁱᵛᵉ came from.</h2>
  <p><ol>
  <li><strong>Creation & Curation rewards</strong> – As you will see from my account stats below, I haven't been very successful this month with creation and curation on the blockchain. A lot of my interactions during February have been off-chain, mainly in <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmYhEvhAUzsjCpFVXcgfd2jKDTBBfmC4kdpgM2LxDAZmAp/discord_roundal_18px.png"/> Discord.</li>
  <li><strong>Delegations</strong> – As I mentioned in <a href="https://www.ecency.com/hive-167922/@frittro/hivepud-feb-2022-plus-monthly-account-stats" target="_blank">last month's #HivePUD post</a>, I have received a couple of very generous delegations early on, from @thekittygirl and <a href="" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmWrFKs6ritavByiU3cdeCQg5AtaJgHoV2ZJrCnKK3Bhe4/theterminal_18px.png"/> <strong>The Terminal</strong></a>'s @rc-assist account. I am really appreciative of these delegations, and I know that I need to make better use of them this coming month.</li>

  <h1>My monthly account stats.</h1>
  <h2>Review of previous month's position.</h2>
  <p>For those who haven't yet read my <a href="https://www.ecency.com/hive-167922/@frittro/hivepud-feb-2022-plus-monthly-account-stats" target="_blank">last month's #HivePUD post</a>, here is a quick recap of where I was at that stage. I still had 44.167SP in my old <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmdiTk78nWRoEwdcELgAWmzVpeyMBoQuLcfu3ku37n6S44/steem_18px.png"/> STEEM account, and was converting the funds from there to the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> HIVE blockchain. That is now complete. I had 86.795HP in my legacy @trisquelwhare account, and was moving those funds to my @frittro account. That is still ongoing this month, and will be throughout March as well. I made a start on my main blog post series in January, but haven't written any more this month about setting up my #homelab using a <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmdtFufSoeZeRAsTjjDWHqd6rKxQZiWC58iBMJtQizPbUn/raspberrypi_18px.png"/> #raspberrypi and <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmUvNcWr7aGv2B2vec5unowhbMymYBNUEVXRywKJpfvvPB/yunohost_18px.png"/> #yunohost.</p>
  <h2>My monthly account stats from PeakD.</h2>
  <p><!-- Screenshots from PeakD, with brief analysis text --></p>
  <p><div class="pull-left"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmQrSDApiH2JegWGVwxLdpDgcaKb9qvBNLTzsUr8xK595F/220301_1406_peakd_account_growth.png" alt="Account Growth graph from PeakD."/></div><strong>Account Growth</strong> – This is the source of the data displayed in the big animated infographic up above. I have noticed during the month that the values in this graph change. I assume this is due to currency fluctuations over the month. This graph, and the above animated infographic, are therefore showing my progress as it stands on 1-Mar-2022, and replaces any similar graph that I have published during the month, including those in the <code>#market-chat</code> channel of <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmWrFKs6ritavByiU3cdeCQg5AtaJgHoV2ZJrCnKK3Bhe4/theterminal_18px.png"/> <strong>The Terminal</strong> Discord server.</p>
  <p><div class="pull-right"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmUBcwQrvA9rBe3TUXnPgXEpPZMMYzP4FHD2gi2RtM3mgm/220301_1406_peakd_author_rewards.png" alt="Author Rewards graph from PeakD."/></div><strong>Author Rewards</strong> – I have only made four posts this month. The last of those hasn't even reached its payout date yet. Even then, when it does, I have declined payment on it, so that won't contribute to my Author Rewards for next month, either. Clearly from this graph, my last #HivePUD post was my most successful one.</p>
  <p><div class="pull-left"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmaGV9o63wvvN8YnDkaKtoPy9p3D45qhniW37U1BWCsAaA/220301_1406_peakd_curation_rewards.png"  alt="Curation Rewards graph from PeakD."/></div><strong>Curation Rewards</strong> – As evidenced by this graph, I have been a little more <em>"on to it"</em> with curation this month, than I was last month. Even so, there is a lot of room for improvement here. My #HivePUD post on 1-Feb-2022 was my most profitable post for this month.</p>
  <p><div class="pull-right"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZbfmGxd5WqxQvEKcdEjEq3nDaAcArnJS5euy5oQY7SRk/220301_1406_peakd_incoming_votes.png" alt="Incoming Votes graph from PeakD."/></div><strong>Incoming Votes</strong> – As I mentioned last month, this graph would be much more useful if it represented the weight of the votes, as well as the quantity of them. I do appreciate the tiny upvotes from @dustbunny though, which help me to get an appreciable payout at least from some of my other lightweight incoming upvotes. Also, note that I haven't yet worked out how to filter these graphs from <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmRRzrH8UhVQXzgboQdKwm6ugFBMgvEF5N3fV9QkVveKBL/peakd_18px.png"/> <strong>PeakD</strong>, so they still show results from all previous months, not just from Feb-2022.</p>
  <p><div class="pull-left"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmPPB29UyLaTcZ9FZdq1ZrW4d9C3UurutXjH5C5qaYyz9w/220301_1406_peakd_outgoing_votes.png" alt="Outgoing Votes graph from PeakD."/></div><strong>Outgoing Votes</strong> – Once again, this graph is quite meaningless without being able to filter it to just show the data for this month only. Hopefully I can work out how to do this filtering before next month's #HivePUD post. Maybe @jarvie can give me some tips on how to accomplish this?</p>
  <p><div class="pull-right"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmeHtFLpbHFMiJvMcdMmkbEXh144kWC85Gy8pj8RzmVfhj/220301_1406_peakd_posts_replies.png" alt="Posts/Replies graph from PeakD."/></div><strong>Posts/Replies</strong> – Thank you to all of the wonderful people who have replied to my posts this month. I do so appreciate the feedback, even more than the upvotes. This is where the magic happens on the <em>social</em> blockchain!</p>
  <p><div class="pull-left"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmcbxUdBf4BZMEthpH9BMYsKhRpoVujXvYqPMkzj4ELghr/220301_1406_peakd_comments.png" alt="Comments graph from PeakD."/></div><strong>Comments</strong> – I have been quite distracted again this month, as I have been learning about using Condenser and similar APIs on the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> <strong>HIVE</strong> social blockchain; and learning more about the changes to <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmYgFVNkUStuY5Ttv9M3w6wFWUB8vpzZZYGnerpTZpt6tz/splinterlands_18px.png"/> <strong>Splinterlands</strong> (as mentioned below); rather than focussing on interacting with live human beings. I need to "up my game" in this regard next month.</p>
  <h2>My monthly account stats from Splinterlands.</h2>
  <p><!-- Screenshots from Splinterlands, and infographics, with brief analysis text --></p>
  <p><div class="pull-right"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmQfT5UKVezECwj31pFx8oYVJsCvDUzMAZuNS9tPCE9Z3F/220301_1021_splinterlands_my_goal.gif"/></div>I am slowly getting closer to my goal of being able to buy myself a <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmX46JDPErPUr4Y5GLVgjA6cGYiBmBXCARmKhgP4HdGN1v/spellbook_18px.png"/> <strong>Summoner's Spellbook</strong> using just <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZbjXSezRnV264YVmgK7CFPdHxDwrYwdwxFF3FExp8JsX/dec_18px.png"/> <strong>DEC</strong> to pay for it. I have a nice collection of <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmY4KzuQ8dNVAqxtvXVyvrtyczHpKHQF8JMhrNWozvsJwg/alpha_18px.png"/> Alpha and <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZQwAewxWmPjy6xo1EFPFrbFNffpMw2e4NCXfBWB9jbwG/beta_18px.png"/> Beta cards from when I was last on the social blockchain back in 2018. I've moved them all to my new account here from my legacy @trisquelwhare account. That old account already has a <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmX46JDPErPUr4Y5GLVgjA6cGYiBmBXCARmKhgP4HdGN1v/spellbook_18px.png"/> <strong>Summoner's Spellbook</strong>, but my new one doesn't yet.
  <p><div class="pull-left"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZsNDiPG1Tq2vxUGqTQVSVb9q8dS4WM5iGj98ws7gyxhm/220301_1940_gsheets_my_splinterlands_stats.png"/></div>My card collection of <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmY4KzuQ8dNVAqxtvXVyvrtyczHpKHQF8JMhrNWozvsJwg/alpha_18px.png"/> Alpha and <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZQwAewxWmPjy6xo1EFPFrbFNffpMw2e4NCXfBWB9jbwG/beta_18px.png"/> Beta cards has been delegated out to a player who runs the @hipnose003 bot account. This month he created the @hipnose002 bot account as well, and we moved some of my cards to that account too. I am now getting 50% of the Season earnings from both of these bot accounts. I have also started receiving <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmSSab9QwUSTabfte5J2fJGq2dMYJGRwc9eT7DpLN1KYYJ/reward_18px.png"/> Reward cards as part of my passive income from these bot accounts, to add to my collection. Also this month, I received a very generous gift of 31 new <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmeHyDuLUcVscMsTJEqCUyMo8SAPAWXUK6TNCwwd3aoAYn/chaos_18px.png"/> Chaos Legion cards from @sassafrass (aka saffisara on Discord). These are the first <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmeHyDuLUcVscMsTJEqCUyMo8SAPAWXUK6TNCwwd3aoAYn/chaos_18px.png"/> Chaos Legion cards that I have ever owned, other than the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmSSab9QwUSTabfte5J2fJGq2dMYJGRwc9eT7DpLN1KYYJ/reward_18px.png"/> Reward cards. Thanks so much for these, @sassafrass!</p>
  <p>I have decided that, once I finally get my <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmX46JDPErPUr4Y5GLVgjA6cGYiBmBXCARmKhgP4HdGN1v/spellbook_18px.png"/> <strong>Summoner's Spellbook</strong>, I will have a go at playing <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmYgFVNkUStuY5Ttv9M3w6wFWUB8vpzZZYGnerpTZpt6tz/splinterlands_18px.png"/> <strong>Splinterlands</strong> again myself, but I will leave all of my <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmY4KzuQ8dNVAqxtvXVyvrtyczHpKHQF8JMhrNWozvsJwg/alpha_18px.png"/> Alpha and <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZQwAewxWmPjy6xo1EFPFrbFNffpMw2e4NCXfBWB9jbwG/beta_18px.png"/> Beta cards where they are, delegated out to bots, and only use my new cards for my own manual battles. That way I get the chance to slowly re-learn the game, and the new features of it since I last played.</p>
  <h2>My monthly Layer 2 token stats.</h2>

  <p><div class="pull-right"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmS77DsVZiLTNaSYXBvgTBQo9hAsmRMQAhMD2ErjjAXw5U/220301_2242_gsheets_layer2_tokens_summary.png"/></div>As a new feature of my monthly account stats, I will be looking at some of my Layer 2 tokens, with a snapshot overview of them all, and a focus on one or two of them each month. To the right here is where I am placed at present with all of my Layer 2 tokens. Some of them can not be staked at all, while many I am actively staking as soon as I get them, to get me started with them.</p>
  <p>Now, let's take a look at a couple of my favourite <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmfXpxx3ARe1LvhSTNEutHxPqFwkcnQMoE9pnxh1mPyFTS/hive_engine_18px.png"/> <strong>Hive-Engine</strong> Layer 2 tokens that I have come across so far, since re-joining the social blockchain.</p>
  <h3>The Pizza Report</h3>
  <p><div class="pull-left"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmY8xJ13K55NGwgTHXjoR1ZAre2VpY8MaJob23YexpKeNC/pizza_report.gif"/></div>I have started off quite stong this month with my <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmem1yDBNsibYYPZi3Z9cfR5tSD7zsGovue5XjG3PxUEiD/hive_pizza_18px.png"/> <strong>HIVE Pizza</strong> hodling. Many people have given me pizza slices since I joined the Pizza <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmYhEvhAUzsjCpFVXcgfd2jKDTBBfmC4kdpgM2LxDAZmAp/discord_roundal_18px.png"/> <strong>Discord</strong> server, and I want to thank everyone for their generous (and tasty) contributions. However, there is one standout pizza-loving friend who has donated the most to me this month, and that was @queenstarr, who gave me a whopping <em>10 whole pizzas!</em> That lovely gift helped me to reach my first goal, of 20 pizzas staked this month. Now I can start giving away some pizza myself, while I work towards my new goal of 200 pizzas. Thanks so much, @queenstarr, you are a pizza legend!</p>
  <h3>The Luv Report</h3>
  <p><div class="pull-right"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmaNGynNZnfrnHafcJkUUKBB7GgwmLhuWjbjMmBEavYHmn/luv_report.gif"/></div>I have only received three of these <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmavMfZ4wNLRQ3tb9FNPew8c1E5XvqAaDqYhbZu4Zxtipi/luv_18px.png"/> <strong>LUV</strong> tokens so far, since I returned to the social blockchain in January this year. Thank you to those who have shown me some <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmavMfZ4wNLRQ3tb9FNPew8c1E5XvqAaDqYhbZu4Zxtipi/luv_18px.png"/> <strong>LUV</strong> up till now. Maybe if I interact more next month, I might be able to reach my current goal of 10 <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmavMfZ4wNLRQ3tb9FNPew8c1E5XvqAaDqYhbZu4Zxtipi/luv_18px.png"/> <strong>LUV</strong> tokens, so that I can start giving some out daily, too.</p>

  <h1>Position statement.</h1>
  <p>There is currently 5.021ꜱᴩ remaining in my legacy <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmdiTk78nWRoEwdcELgAWmzVpeyMBoQuLcfu3ku37n6S44/steem_18px.png"/> STEEM account, which I am just going to leave in there. My legacy account on <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> <strong>HIVE</strong> still has 60.291ʜᴩ in it, and I am powering that down at a rate of about 6.690ʜᴩ per week. My main blog post series about setting up my #homelab using a <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmdtFufSoeZeRAsTjjDWHqd6rKxQZiWC58iBMJtQizPbUn/raspberrypi_18px.png"/> #raspberrypi and <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmUvNcWr7aGv2B2vec5unowhbMymYBNUEVXRywKJpfvvPB/yunohost_18px.png"/> #yunohost has gone onto the back-burner again this month, and I am so far behind on <a href="https://github.com/users/frittro/projects/2" target="_blank">my planned schedule</a> for the #installfest that I doubt at this stage that I can get back on track. I may need to re-work my whole schedule again. As always, I would like to acknowledge the owner of the @hipnose002 and @hipnose003 accounts, for his efforts in running my <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmYgFVNkUStuY5Ttv9M3w6wFWUB8vpzZZYGnerpTZpt6tz/splinterlands_18px.png"/> <strong>Splinterlands</strong> card collection in his bot, earning me a nice passive income.</p>
