<h1>My intro for the Hive Learners community.</h1>
<p><em>This is my introduction post for joining the HIVE Learners community, as instructed in <a href="https://www.ecency.com/hive-153850/@kronias/important-guidelines-for-completing-verification-and-introduction-process-in-hive-learners-community" >this post</a>. It includes a photograph of myself holding a piece of paper with my HIVE username, today's date, and the name of the country that I live in. It also includes the requisite "three or four more photos". It is 470 words long, excluding this summary and the image credits section at the bottom.</em></p>

<h2>Who I am</h2>
<p><em>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.</em> I bring you all greetings in the indigenous language of the Māori of <em>Aotearoa</em> / New Zealand, where I live.</p>
<p> My username is @frittro, and that is my preferred name. I am a 50+ year old "elder geek". I'm married to @frittni for over 21 years now. We do not have any children, unfortunately. We live in West Auckland, a suburb of <em>Aotearoa</em> / New Zealand's largest city, (but it is not the capitol, which is in Wellington). Both my wife and I live with the effects of disability – she was born with <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmQ8Z2DMYf7Sq4ssFra8AbSZvfA5Qir3uGfSGpkjTP6rTM/sb_ribbon_18px.png"/> Spina Bifida; and I have various issues including <a href="https://ecency.com/created/actuallyautistic" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZCG6iPzkfHputwavX2hX5bGgpEQWcTSuSoGzL7f6RAfu/actually_autistic_18px.png"/> autism</a>, type 2 <a href="https://ecency.com/created/diabetes" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmX8nx8LoK2S67ipYdPekSvTSW5XRTYPdyng53DJdKSeUc/diabetes_18px.png"/> diabetes</a>, <a href="https://ecency.com/created/depression" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmeuL4hHvevHt7YnmwR1hE6hmd1q7Zkrqk8SKfU2rFBnnH/mhnz.png"/> depression</a>, and a <a href="https://ecency.com/created/cardiac" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmZHGLmBqj5zPLnRTNv8jvUx8hP3S9UvdiK3GoUiHGKHCk/heart_fdn_18px.png"/> cardiac</a> condition, with stents in my heart.</p>

<p> I am a new <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQma2JHmpCFGMiJob7Cc2J8KhZuAZ1NucPSWbga61xs7Cn9/hive_18px.png"/> Hivean, but I used to be on the <img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmdiTk78nWRoEwdcELgAWmzVpeyMBoQuLcfu3ku37n6S44/steem_18px.png"/> Steem blockchain back in 2018 or so, under the username of @trisquelwhare.</p>

<h2>Why I am here now</h2>
<p> I came back to the social blockchain this year to blog about my new project, which involves <a href="https://ecency.com/created/selfhosting" target="_blank">#selfhosting</a> at home on a <a href="https://ecency.com/created/raspberrypi" taget="_blank"><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmdtFufSoeZeRAsTjjDWHqd6rKxQZiWC58iBMJtQizPbUn/raspberrypi_18px.png"/> #raspberrypi</a> single board computer. When I learned about the intervening history of the Steem blockchain, and the mass migration of the userbase here to HIVE, I decided to tag along here, as well. There is a lot for me to re-learn about being on a social blockchain, along with the new features of HIVE itself. I've joined three learning communties (they didn't even have such a thing as "communities" when I was last on Steem), including <a href="https://www.ecency.com/created/hive-106316" target="_blank">Silver Bloggers</a>, <a href="https://www.ecency.com/created/hive-101265" target="_blank">The Terminal</a>, and this one, <a href="https://www.ecency.com/created/hive-153850" target="_blank">Hive Learners</a>. I want to learn as much as I can about blogging here on HIVE, as quickly as I can, so that I can concentrate on my new project, which is what I'm really here for.</p>

<h2>Registering for Hive Learners</h2>
<p> Below are the remainder of the photos that are required, according to <a href="https://www.ecency.com/hive-153850/@kronias/important-guidelines-for-completing-verification-and-introduction-process-in-hive-learners-community" >this post</a>, for joining the Hive Learners community and getting verified.</p>

<p> I'm not just poking my tongue out at you all, here. This is me doing a traditional Māori greeting for you all, and a <em ><a href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=pukana" >pūkana</a></em>, which is common during traditional welcoming ceremonies here, such as during a <em ><a href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=powhiri" >pōwhiri</a></em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmTiMYTSdVt3vK5EoWSuhD6hswXc2vn2m8zwishRHxEuwj/cabbage_tree.png"/></p>
<p>This is a cabbage tree, or <em ><a href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=t%C4%AB+k%C5%8Duka" >tī kōuka</a></em>, a common native tree here in <em>Aotearoa</em> / New Zealand. I took this photo in my local park, the same place where the <em>Waharoa ki pou</em> Māori art installation was in the photo above, where I displayed my ID paper.</p>

<p>This is me, at the entrance to our local shopping mall. The native bush behind me is fake, but the photo of me in front of it is real.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ecency.com/DQmPfVejtyZcWo7qyaYxHj861ha76BdtEXufQBawHMBvFRM/frittro_and_cake.png"/></p>
<p>Here I am sitting at a cafe in the shopping mall, just inside the entrance where the previous photo was taken. You can still see the fake, plastic native bush behind me.</p>
